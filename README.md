# Food Order App (ReactMeals)

Small practice created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and the corresponding React template
consisting of a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that simulates
a food ordering app with some products and a shopping cart.

For the development of the app the following React features have been implemented:
- React hooks:
  - useState
  - useEffect
  - useReducer
  - useContext
  - useRef
- Conditional rendering
- Styling with CSS modules
- Portals
- Fragments
